# Spring-For-Python
*Spring for Python is a lightweight, open source Web framework based on Python.*

# Functional Features
- Dependency Injection: With dependency injection, you can achieve decoupling and flexibility between objects, simplifying code writing and maintenance.
- Section-oriented programming: Section-oriented programming enables business processes to deal with cross-cutting concerns, such as transaction management and logging, without changing the business logic.
- Inversion of control: Through inversion of control, the creation of objects and the management of dependencies are handled by the container, reducing the coupling degree of code.
- RESTful Support: Supports RESTful routing and resource management, making it easier to build RESTful apis.
- Modular design: The framework adopts a modular design, so that developers can choose the required functional modules according to the actual needs, reducing unnecessary complexity.
